Prerequisites
Add a new remote to LAV Filters and FFmpeg submodules:
 - for LAV Filters, "git remote add upstream https://github.com/Nevcairiel/LAVFilters.git"
 - for FFmpeg, "git remote add upstream git://git.1f0.de/ffmpeg.git"

Warning:
Before updating LAV Filters always makes sure that no update is required on MPC-HC side.
If there are some changes in LAV Filters interfaces or settings, some changes are likely
to be needed in MPC-HC. If the update breaks compatibility with older LAV Filters versions,
remember to update the version check in FGFilterLAV.cpp.
